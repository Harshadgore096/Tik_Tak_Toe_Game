Tic-Tac-Toe Game in React - Features
The Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React offers a dynamic and interactive gaming experience with the following key features:

1. Two-Player Gameplay:
Alternating Turns: The game alternates turns between two players, "X" and "O". Player "X" always goes first.
Interactive Board: Players take turns clicking on the empty squares of a 3x3 grid to place their marks.

2. Real-Time Game State Updates:
Dynamic State Management: Using React's useState, the game keeps track of:
The current state of the board (which squares are marked with "X" or "O").
The current player (whether it’s "X" or "O").
The game's winner or draw status.
Automatic State Update: Every move updates the board and game state in real-time, making the gameplay feel responsive.

3. Win Detection:
Winner Calculation: After each move, the game checks whether a player has achieved a winning condition:
Three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
Winner Announcement: Once a player wins, the game automatically declares the winner and prevents further moves.


4. Draw Detection:
Draw Logic: If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game detects the draw and announces it.
Preventing Further Moves: After a win or draw, no further moves are allowed until the game is reset.


5. Reset Game Functionality:
Restart the Game: After a game concludes (win or draw), players can click the “Start New Game” button to reset the game board and start a fresh game.
Clearing the Board: The board is cleared, and the state is reset so players can play again without reloading the page.

6. Mobile-Responsive Design:
Responsive UI: The Tic-Tac-Toe game is designed to work on various screen sizes, ensuring a good experience on both desktops and mobile devices.
Touch-Friendly: The clickable board squares are large enough to be tapped easily on mobile screens.


7. Simple User Interface (UI):
Clean, Minimal Design: The interface features a clean layout with large buttons for "X" and "O", clear labels for turn indicators, and a "Start New Game" button.
Highlighting Winning Squares (Future Enhancement): When a player wins, the squares forming the winning line can be visually highlighted (e.g., with a color change) to make the win more prominent.


8. Easy to Play, Easy to Understand:
Intuitive Gameplay: The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are easy to understand, making it accessible for players of all ages.
Simple Controls: Players interact with the game simply by clicking on the grid squares, making it ideal for quick, casual gaming.
